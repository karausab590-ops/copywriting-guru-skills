Please be as specific as possible here in order to get the best quality research. Please include that you want deep research to compile all of the research found into a doc as well, and it should be a minimum of 6 pages worth of research.
```

2. Paste the deep research prompt from Prompt #3 output
3. Start Research
4. Copy and paste all research into its own doc

## Step 2: Foundational Docs

### Prompt #1 - Avatar Sheet
```
Based on the attached deep research document, I want you to please complete the attached Avatar Sheet Template

[ATTACH THE COMPLETED DEEP RESEARCH DOC]

[COPY AND PASTE THE FULL OUTPUT INTO ANOTHER DOC AND DOWNLOAD IT]

**Avatar Sheet Template includes:**

### Prompt #2 - Offer Brief
```

[ATTACH OFFER BRIEF TEMPLATE]

[COPY AND PASTE THE FULL OUTPUT INTO ANOTHER DOC AND DOWNLOAD IT]
```

**Offer Brief Template includes:**
- Product Overview
- Target Market
- The Offer + Unique Mechanism
- Proof and Credibility
- Competitive Landscape
- Customer Journey
- Emotional Triggers
- Key Selling Points

### Prompt #3 - Necessary Beliefs (Todd Brown E5)
```
Great work! Now analyze the E5 Method for Necessary Beliefs.

The key insight: It is about the magnificence of the ARGUMENT, not the magnificence of the WORDS.

Create the 6 beliefs customer must hold before buying:
1. Market Belief - Why this market/opportunity is worth pursuing
2. Competition Belief - Why competitors/alternatives fall short
3. Credibility Belief - Why they should trust us
4. Mechanism Belief - Why our unique mechanism works
5. Proof Belief - Evidence that it actually works
6. Urgency Belief - Why they need to act now

Remember: Every marketing campaign is about taking the prospect on a journey. Lead them to a belief that pre-sells them on the offer before you even talk about it.

## Step 3: Swipe Analysis
Analyze competitor ads and successful campaigns for structure (not words).

---

## Step 4: Write
Write the advertorial/sales copy using the foundational docs.

---

## Step 5: Chief Review
Expert review of the copy for optimization.

---

## Key Principle: Arguments Over Words

From Todd Brown E5 Method:
> Stop writing copy and start crafting arguments.

- Internet Marketing approach = magnificent WORDS (power words, hyperbolic phrases)
- Agora approach = magnificent ARGUMENTS (compelling logical/emotional structure)

The difference:
- BAD: Astonishing steroid-like traffic generation system that brings a tsunami of buyers
- GOOD: A rock-solid argument that logically leads to one conclusion

Always introduce a **Unique Mechanism** - a new, different, and superior way to get the result they want. Something proprietary they can only get from you.
